One of the key advantages of blockchain is its decentralized nature, eliminating the need for middlemen, which reduces both time and potential conflicts.

Besides the high performance and high security that XDC already offers, these customers also demand privacy, meaning that their transactions and ledger should not be disclosed to the public. This requirement prohibits them from directly submitting transactions to XDC. Instead, they should only checkpoint snapshots of their ledger to XDC in order to extract XDC\u2019s security.</p> <p>From a system perspective, \u201csecurity via checkpointing\u201d is achieved via Layer-2 (L2) techniques, such as rollups and subnets. The most popular rollup technique, namely optimistic rollup, is not suitable for our use case. This is because while transaction execution is offloaded to L2, all these L2 transactions are still submitted to L1 as a record. Another popular rollup called zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup solves this problem. But ZK computation is slow, and the type of use cases it can currently support is very limited (such as token transfers), which cannot fulfill the diverse business needs of XDC\u2019s enterprise and institutional customers.</p> <p>On the other hand, subnet is a perfect solution. By subnet, the customer runs a blockchain and checkpoints its critical consensus data to the parent chain. This way, not only is privacy preserved, the subnet can have its own security and resiliency besides those provided by the parent chain. This is particularly useful to enterprise and institutional customers who may collaborate with untrusted partners. A common criticism against subnet solutions is the high entry bar and operational cost of running a blockchain. However, in XDC\u2019s case, this is indeed welcomed becomes enterprise and institutional customers prefer owning the infrastructure in a private and isolated domain.</p> <p>Motivated by this opportunity, XDC\u2019s core protocol team has tailor-designed a subnet solution for XDC\u2019s enterprise and institutional customers. It has the following main features: 1.  the subnet will be a sovereign, permissioned, and high-performing blockchain wholly owned by the customer. 2.  the subnet will be driven by XDC2.0, the most advanced and secure consensus engine originally-built for XDC in-house, and will be deployed to the XDC mainnet, too. 3.  a security level equivalent to the sum security of the subnet AND XDC mainnet. 4.  native EVM smart contract support. 5.  total privacy (i.e., no visibility) of the subset transactions on the XDC mainnet. 6.  full access and compatibility to XDC\u2019s abundant SDK and tools, such as the explorer and forensic monitoring system.</p>"},{"location":"subnet/#architecture","title":"Architecture","text":"<p>The architecture consists of the following key components owned by the customer:</p> <ul> <li>A subnet driven by the XDC2.0 consensus engine, with system configurations tailored for the customer</li> <li>A relayer program that checkpoint critical consensus data of the subnet to the XDC Mainnet</li> <li>A smart contract in the XDC Mainnet that verifies and records the checkpoints</li> <li>Wallet APIs that enable additional protection of subnet transaction from the XDC Mainnet</li> <li>The subnet will also natively support XDC\u2019s abundant utility tools such as blockchain explorer and forensic monitor</li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"subnet/Installation_guide/","title":"Installation Guide","text":"<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain technology, staying ahead of the curve is essential.

Think of them as self-contained mini-blockchains, each with its own unique features and functionalities. These subnets operate alongside the main blockchain but offer more flexibility and scalability.</p> <p>How Do Blockchain Subnets Work? Blockchain subnets work by segregating the main blockchain into smaller, more manageable parts. This segmentation brings several advantages such as Scalability, Customization, Privacy and Security.</p> <p>Setting Up Your Own Blockchain Subnet XDC Subnet is a powerful technology that allows you to create a secure, scalable, and decentralized network within the XDC Ecosystem. It enables various use cases, including creating private subnets, deploying decentralized applications (DApps), and more. In this guide, we\u2019ll walk you through the steps to set up your own XDC Subnet, opening doors to a world of possibilities.</p> <p>Step 1: Uninstall Old Versions</p> <p>Before you dive into setting up XDC Subnet, ensure that you don\u2019t have any conflicting packages from previous installations.

This results in significant electricity consumption and poses environmental concerns. Recognizing these drawbacks, XinFin transitioned away from PoW and adopted Proof of Stake (PoS), a more energy-efficient consensus methodology. Eventually, XinFin advanced to XinFin Delegated Proof of Stake (XDPoS), which further enhances the efficiency and security of the network.</p> <p>To understand XDC Network\u2019s decision to adopt XDPoS, it\u2019s essential to explore the various consensus mechanisms.</p>"},{"location":"xdcchain/xdpos/#understanding-consensus-pow-vs-pos-vs-xdpos","title":"Understanding Consensus: PoW vs. PoS vs. XDPoS","text":"<p>In blockchain technology, consensus refers to a general agreement among nodes in the network, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the distributed ledger. Unlike centralized systems like banks, where a central authority maintains records, blockchain relies on distributed ledgers to record information. Consensus ensures that all nodes agree on the state of the blockchain, including account balances, transactions, and more.</p> <p>Proof of Work (PoW) PoW relies on nodes solving cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks. This process requires significant computational power and consumes vast amounts of electricity, making it environmentally unsustainable and costly.</p> <p>Proof of Stake (PoS) PoS eliminates the need for energy-intensive computations. Instead of miners, PoS relies on validators who lock a portion of their cryptocurrency as a stake. Validators are chosen to propose the next block based on their stake and uptime. When a validator discovers a block that can be added to the blockchain, they validate it by placing a bet on it. The validators receive rewards proportional to their bets.</p> <p>XinFin Delegated Proof of Stake (XDPoS) XDPoS is an evolution of PoS and offers greater efficiency. It uses a reputation-based system to achieve consensus, where master nodes create blocks in a round-robin manner. The network elects block producers (also known as witnesses) who are responsible for validating transactions and creating the next block. The key features of XDPoS include:</p> <ul> <li>Random Election of Block Producers: Block producers are elected randomly and are limited in number. They are responsible for signing and creating blocks.</li> <li>Block Validators: These full nodes verify that the blocks created by block producers adhere to consensus rules.</li> <li>Community Governance: Unlike PoS, XDPoS provides the community with more governance rights, allowing them to have a greater say in the network\u2019s operations.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"xdcchain/xdpos/#pros-and-cons-of-xinfin-delegated-proof-of-stake","title":"Pros and Cons of XinFin Delegated Proof of Stake","text":""},{"location":"xdcchain/xdpos/#advantages","title":"Advantages","text":"<ul> <li>Speed: XDPoS enables faster transaction processing due to the limited number of witnesses involved.</li> <li>Cost Efficiency: The reduction in the number of participants in block creation lowers transaction costs.</li> <li>Scalability: XDPoS improves the network\u2019s scalability by ensuring efficient block creation and validation.</li> <li>Security: The reputation system and regular monitoring of witnesses help maintain the integrity of the network.
