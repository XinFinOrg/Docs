title: Quick Guide: XDC Chain
---

Welcome to the Quick Guide for XDC Chain! This document is designed to provide you with a comprehensive overview of the XDC Network, its technology, and the tools you need to start your journey. Whether you're new to blockchain or an experienced developer, this guide will help you navigate the key resources and get up to speed with the XDC Network.

## Getting Started

The XDC Network is a powerful, enterprise-grade blockchain platform designed to facilitate secure, efficient, and scalable decentralized applications (DApps) and global trade solutions. If you're just starting your journey with the XDC Network, this section will help you understand the fundamental concepts, terminology, and processes.

## Mainnet

The XDC Network's Mainnet is the live, operational blockchain where actual transactions take place. Understanding the Mainnet is crucial for interacting with the XDC Network in a real-world environment.

- **Mainnet Details:** Learn more about the XDC Mainnet, its architecture, and operational specifics. [Network Information and RPC Providers](./rpc.md)
- **Explorer:** Track transactions, smart contracts, and more on the XDC Mainnet using the official blockchain explorer. [Mainnet Explorer](https://xdcscan.io/)
- **Stats:** Access real-time statistics about the XDC Mainnet, including transaction volumes, network health, and more. [Mainnet Stats](https://stats.xdc.org/) | [XinFin Network Stats](https://xinfin.network/#stats)

## Apothem Testnet

The Apothem Testnet is the testing environment for the XDC Network. It's an ideal place to experiment with your DApps, smart contracts, and other blockchain-based solutions before deploying them on the Mainnet.

- **Testnet Details:** Get an in-depth understanding of the Apothem Testnet and how to use it effectively. [Testnet Details](./rpc.md)
- **Explorer:** View and track transactions on the Apothem Testnet using the official Testnet explorer. [Apothem/Testnet Explorer](https://apothem.xdcscan.io/)
- **Stats:** Monitor the performance and activity on the Apothem Testnet. [Testnet Stats](https://apothem.network/#stats)
- **Faucet:** Need test XDC tokens? Use the Apothem Testnet faucet to get free tokens for testing. [Get Test XDC](https://faucet.blocksscan.io/)

## XDC Devnet
The XDC Devnet is a development-focused environment that allows developers to test and deploy their projects in a controlled setting. It’s perfect for experimenting with new features, running simulations, and fine-tuning DApps before launching them on the Mainnet or Testnet.

- **Devnet Explorer:** Track and analyze transactions, smart contracts, and other activities on the XDC Devnet. [Devnet Explorer](https://devnet.xdcscan.io/)
